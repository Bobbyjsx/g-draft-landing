# g-draft ✦ AI-Powered Git Assistant

`g-draft` is a hybrid **CLI + TUI** developer tool that turbocharges your Git workflows using high-performance AI. It automates the "boring" parts of version control—like writing commit messages and PR descriptions—while providing expert-level security and performance audits before you even push your code.

## 🚀 Quick Usage

`gdraft` works as both a standalone CLI and an interactive TUI.

### Interactive TUI (Recommended)
```bash
gdraft tui
```

### CLI Mode
```bash
gdraft commit --copy   # Generate commit message & copy to clipboard
gdraft pr --copy       # Generate PR description & copy to clipboard
gdraft review          # Run AI code review on current changes
```

### ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Workflow
- **Conventional Commits**: Automatically generates structured, present-tense commit messages (≤ 72 chars) from your staged changes.
- **Context-Aware PRs**: Generates detailed Pull Request descriptions. Automatically detects and fills your project's `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- **Expert Code Review**: Performs rigorous audits using internalized **Skills** for Security, Performance, and Clean Code.
- **Action-Aware Prompts**: The AI is explicitly aware of the current task (commit vs. review), enabling targeted custom instructions like "For commits, include issue-ID".

### 🏎️ Instant Generations (Sub-2s)
- **Persistent Background Agent**: Launches and warms up the AI process immediately on startup. No more waiting for "cold starts."
- **Zero Round-Trip Handshake**: Uses pipelined ACP (Agent Client Protocol) to start processing prompts instantly.
- **Model Routing**: Automatically routes tasks to the fastest models (like `gemini-3-flash`) for instant commit messages.
- **Parallel Data Loading**: Fetches git diffs and prepares the AI pipeline concurrently.

### 🖥️ High-Performance TUI
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A centralized hub to manage your branch status and AI actions.
- **Real-Time Reasoning**: See the agent's "thoughts" and tool calls stream with a natural typing effect as they happen.
- **Auto-Scrolling Progress**: The AGENT PROGRESS box automatically stays pinned to the latest reasoning steps.
- **Accept & Commit**: Review AI suggestions, edit them manually in the TUI, and commit directly with one keystroke.
- **Browser-Standard Scrolling**: Smooth scrollable areas with a visual scrollbar and full **Vim Keybindings** (`j`/`k`, `g`/`G`, `ctrl+d`/`ctrl+u`).

### 💾 Smart Data & Persistence
- **Global Storage**: All logs and cache are moved out of your workspace and stored in `~/.gdraft/` to keep your repositories clean.
- **Project-Aware Cache**: Returning to a screen? Your last generation is instantly loaded from the cache.
- **Staleness Detection**: Automatically detects if your code has changed since the last AI generation and prompts for a refresh.
- **Audit Logs**: Full prompt/response history stored as structured JSON in `~/.gdraft/projects/[id]/logs`.

## 🚀 Installation

### From NPM (Recommended)
Install `gdraft` globally:

   git clone https://github.com/Bobbyjsx/g-draft.git
   cd g-draft
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Development**:
   Run the TypeScript source directly:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev -- tui    # Launch the TUI
   pnpm dev -- commit # CLI mode
   ```

3. **Build**:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

## 🔌 AI Provider Setup

`g-draft` acts as an orchestrator for your local AI CLIs. Ensure at least one is installed and authenticated:

- **Gemini**: `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`
- **Claude**: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- **Amazon Q**: [AWS Q Setup](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/)
- **Codex**: [OpenAI Codex Setup](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex)

Verify detection:
```bash
gdraft providers
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

`g-draft` uses a hybrid configuration model:
- **Global Config**: Managed via `gdraft config set ...` (stored in system config).
- **Project Config**: Create a `.gdraft.json` in your repository for project-specific overrides.

```json
{
  "baseBranch": "main",
  "provider": "claude"
}
```
